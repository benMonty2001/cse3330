This repository is a complete record of a collaborative project I participated in for an introductory database class at the University of Texas at Arlington. This project was a group effort. Explicit attributions are contained within **Report.pdf**

The project description was to build a GUI application to interface with the the LMS.sql database, which my team also built from scratch. The database normalization schema was provided, although by the final exam, we were fully prepared to normalize the database ourselves.

USAGE: python main_win.py
